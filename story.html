                <p>"Witches are not born, they are created." This simple sentence is the answer to the question
                    sorcerers
                    have been trying to figure out for hundreds of years. Yet here it sits, taunting both them and me.

                <p>"First you must gather these ingredients and use them to make a paste." I felt awful for stealing
                    this book from that strange old women, but after I started reading it I realized that if I knew that
                    if I had known what was in it, I would have killed her to get this book.</p>

                <p>"With that paste, you must draw this magic circle." This ritual could be a lie. This whole book could
                    be a lie. Nothing could end up happening. Or doing this could kill me. I don't care. This is my last
                    chance. If this doesn't work, I'm dead anyway. Nothing to lose and everything to gain.</p>
