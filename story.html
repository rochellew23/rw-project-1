                <p><span class="turnToRed">"Witches are not born, they are created."</span> This simple sentence is the
                    answer to the question
                    sorcerers
                    have been trying to figure out for hundreds of years. Yet here it sits, taunting both them and me.

                <p>"First you must gather these ingredients and use them to make a paste." I felt awful for stealing
                    this book from that strange old women, but after I started reading it I realized that if I knew that
                    if I had known what was in it, <span class="turnToRed">I would have killed her</span> to get this
                    book.</p>

                <p>"With that paste, you must draw this magic circle." This ritual could be a lie. This whole book could
                    be a lie. Nothing could end up happening. Or doing this could kill me. I don't care. This is my last
                    chance. <span class="turnToRed">If this doesn't work, I'm dead anyway.</span> Nothing to lose and
                    everything to gain.</p>

                <p>"Lie down in the magic circle." I won't lie. I'm scared. If this works,<span
                        class="turnToRed"> nothing will be the same</span>. I
                    won't be the same. But isn't that what I wanted? Didn't I want this magic? Didn't I want this power?
